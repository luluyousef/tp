## **Introduction**
***

DukePro(f) is a schedule-planning desktop application that assists **university professors** in managing
their **consultations**, through the usage of an intuitive **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**<sup>1</sup>
and an easy-to-navigate **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**<sup>2</sup>.

It is named `DukePro(f)` (Duke-Professor) because our project's target audience is professors, and it is also a nod
to our CS2103T iP (individual Project), which was named `Duke`.

Amidst long hours of lectures and tutorials in the week, professors may still need to cater timeslots for student
consultations, which can be hard to come by and difficult to keep track of. This is where Dukepro(f)
comes in to help you out! 

With DukePro(f), you will be able to:

* Add, edit, and delete your consultations
* List all of your consultations, or just your next consultation
* List your free time slots for consultation booking
* Block certain time slots to ensure your consultations don't clash with other commitments
* And many other small quality of life features!

<hr />

<sup>1</sup>Command-Line Interface (CLI): How you interact with the application, i.e. by 
typing in text (commands).<br>
<sup>2</sup>Graphical User Interface (GUI): The visual component of DukePro(f), and the form by which you 
interact with it.

## **5. Commands and Their Features**
***
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  * E.g. In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Lulu Yousef`.

* Items in square brackets are optional. (Items not in square brackets are necessary!)
  * E.g. `[tag/TAG]` is an optional parameter.

* Parameters that can have more than one entry will be anteceded by a `...`
  * E.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can have more than one entry, so `tag/supplmentary tag/important` is accepted.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  * E.g. If the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATE`, `d/DATE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you have specified it multiple times, only the 
  last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  * E.g. If you specify `d/2021-11-11 d/2021-11-21`, only `d/2021-11-21` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be 
  ignored.<br>
  * E.g. If the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

* Entries for `n/NAME` and `tag/TAG` must be alphanumeric.<br>
  * E.g. `n/Poh Hui-En Ruth` will not be accepted as it has a hyphen in it.

* Entries for `d/DATE` must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

* Entries for `t/TIMESLOT` must be in the 24h format of HHmm-HHmm and must be a time slot between 0000 and 
  2359 (inclusive).<br>
  * E.g. `t/2300-0000` will not be accepted as the time passes over to a new day.
  
* Tags cannot span more than one word.
  * E.g. `tag/URGENT` will be accepted but not `tag/URGENT MATTER`.

* Tags with the text "URGENT" and "supplementary" have special tag colours to enable the user to indicate
  the consultation's severity (these tag names are case-sensitive!).<br>
  * `tag/URGENT` will be shown as ![urgent tag](images/URGENT tag.png)
  * `tag/supplementary` will be shown as ![supplementary tag](images/supplementary tag.png)
